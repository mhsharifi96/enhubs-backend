    "02:41.880 --> 02:45.100\n",
    "a very common mistake that people think that okay,\n",
    "\n",
    "02:45.600 --> 02:49.660\n",
    "once they learn a certain sound on YouTube or in a private coaching\n",

    "02:53.800 --> 02:57.750\n",
    "it. And they expect themselves to use it effortlessly\n",
    "\n",
    "02:57.830 --> 03:01.270\n",
    "when they're speaking and they get really frustrated with themselves. For not\n",
    "\n",
    "03:01.770 --> 03:05.670\n",
    "being able to do that. And I want to say that\n",
    "\n",
    "03:05.990 --> 03:09.790\n",
    "the part about learning how to make a sound is just the\n",
    "\n",
    "03:10.290 --> 03:14.230\n",
    "first step or maybe second step. And most of the work is about the\n",
    "\n",
    "03:14.730 --> 03:17.830\n",
    "implementation and the repetition, and that part is\n",
    "\n",
    "03:17.990 --> 03:21.170\n",
    "usually overlooked. So I want to talk about that\n",
    "\n",
    "03:21.670 --> 03:24.370\n",
    "today. Yeah, I'm glad you're here today to talk about this. This is so.\n",
    "\n",
    "03:24.530 --> 03:27.930\n",
    "Because again, when we put so much time into something. Right. And we think\n",
    "\n",
    "03:28.430 --> 03:30.690\n",
    "it should work. Right, we think it should work because everything else, we can kind\n",
    "\n",
    "03:31.190 --> 03:33.490\n",
    "of learn it, make it happen most of the time. But language is a special\n",
    "\n",
    "03:33.990 --> 03:37.410\n",
    "case. So I understand that you have kind\n",
    "\n",
    "03:37.910 --> 03:40.770\n",
    "of a framework that you've been working with students on that seems to work based\n",
    "\n",
    "03:41.270 --> 03:44.530\n",
    "on student experience. Can you show our listeners how they would go about making\n",
    "\n",
    "03:45.030 --> 03:48.290\n",
    "sure they learn the pronunciation sounds correctly and then really getting out there,\n",
    "\n",
    "03:48.880 --> 03:52.080\n",
    "putting it into action? How can we do it? Absolutely.\n",
    "\n",
    "03:52.160 --> 03:56.720\n",
    "So, first of all, the most important step is perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "03:57.120 --> 04:00.920\n",
    "That means that before even attempting at trying to pronounce\n",
    "\n",
    "04:01.420 --> 04:05.160\n",
    "a certain sound, it is so important to be able to hear it\n",
    "\n",
    "04:05.660 --> 04:09.280\n",
    "and to recognize it. Why am I saying that? Because if someone\n",
    "\n",
    "04:10.400 --> 04:14.160\n",
    "doesn't have a certain sound in their native language, it's very likely that they won't\n",
    "\n",
    "04:14.660 --> 04:18.000\n",
    "even hear the nuances of that sound. Or they'll hear it, but their brain\n",
    "\n",
    "04:18.500 --> 04:21.840\n",
    "will analyze it as a different sound. So it's important to understand that\n",
    "\n",
    "04:22.340 --> 04:25.800\n",
    "what they're hearing is not exactly how they categorize it or how they\n",
    "\n",
    "04:26.300 --> 04:29.600\n",
    "perceive it in their brain. So they need to perceive it as a new sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "04:29.920 --> 04:33.360\n",
    "And as such, that means that they need to kind of, like,\n",
    "\n",
    "04:33.920 --> 04:37.160\n",
    "treat it differently in how they think about\n",
    "\n",
    "04:37.660 --> 04:41.480\n",
    "it and use it. So perception is really important. Yeah. And also,\n",
    "\n",
    "04:41.980 --> 04:45.280\n",
    "sometimes there are very subtle nuances in English, like sheep, ship,\n",
    "\n",
    "04:45.440 --> 04:49.120\n",
    "pool, pull, bed, bad. Like, you know,\n",
    "\n",
    "04:49.200 --> 04:52.360\n",
    "vowel sounds that don't exist in many different languages,\n",
    "\n",
    "04:52.860 --> 04:56.320\n",
    "like two different, very close vowel sounds. And then people\n",
    "\n",
    "04:56.820 --> 04:59.920\n",
    "usually merge them. So before you're even trying to make them, they need to hear\n",
    "\n",
    "05:00.420 --> 05:03.920\n",
    "the difference. Yeah, exactly. Again, like you said, we can't hear what we don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "05:04.240 --> 05:07.680\n",
    "And that's maybe that's why it's so intense for beginners to really\n",
    "\n",
    "05:08.180 --> 05:11.840\n",
    "understand fast, natural English. Because if you don't have a sense of\n",
    "\n",
    "05:12.340 --> 05:14.800\n",
    "any of those sounds, you don't know what you're listening for. I love that.\n",
    "\n",
    "05:15.300 --> 05:19.100\n",
    "Right, okay, exactly. And one of the things about improving\n",
    "\n",
    "05:19.600 --> 05:23.100\n",
    "your. Your listening skills and understanding native speakers better is,\n",
    "\n",
    "05:23.600 --> 05:26.780\n",
    "like, you have. It has to go through your mouth when you do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "05:26.860 --> 05:30.060\n",
    "Then this is why pronunciation Is so important because when you do it, you're able\n",
    "\n",
    "05:30.560 --> 05:33.540\n",
    "to understand it better too. Yeah, that makes total sense. Okay,\n",
    "\n",
    "05:34.040 --> 05:36.460\n",
    "so this is an important first step. I feel like it's kind of the foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "05:36.960 --> 05:40.740\n",
    "building our house here. All right, so sections number one, Hadar. What would be the\n",
    "\n",
    "05:41.240 --> 05:44.850\n",
    "next one then? Well, the next one is very\n",
    "\n",
    "05:45.350 --> 05:48.370\n",
    "simple pronunciation. It's the production of the sound. It's very\n",
    "\n",
    "05:48.870 --> 05:52.450\n",
    "technical. It's what you do exactly with your lips, with your\n",
    "\n",
    "05:52.950 --> 05:53.890\n",
    "tongue, with your jaw,\n",
    "\n",
    "05:56.050 --> 05:59.850\n",
    "with your cheeks, Everything about your mouth. And every\n",
    "\n",
    "06:00.350 --> 06:03.490\n",
    "human being can pronounce any possible sound in\n",
    "\n",
    "06:04.370 --> 06:08.850\n",
    "any language. It's just a matter of understanding what to do with\n",
    "\n",
    "06:09.330 --> 06:12.450\n",
    "your articulation organs, which is what I discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "06:14.370 --> 06:18.180\n",
    "Let's say you want to practice or improve your R in\n",
    "\n",
    "06:18.340 --> 06:21.300\n",
    "American English. So you need to know what the tongue does, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "06:21.800 --> 06:24.860\n",
    "Yes. So you pull the tongue back. The sides of the tongue touch the sides\n",
    "\n",
    "06:25.360 --> 06:28.620\n",
    "of the teeth. The lips need to round. The tip of the tongue\n",
    "\n",
    "06:29.120 --> 06:32.100\n",
    "shouldn't touch anything. So we have these steps that you need to go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "06:32.420 --> 06:35.660\n",
    "And then ideally you practice it a bit and then you get to\n",
    "\n",
    "06:36.160 --> 06:39.940\n",
    "the right sound. Okay. Do you recommend that students kind of mimic? They watch\n",
    "\n",
    "06:40.440 --> 06:43.380\n",
    "someone pronouncing it and they kind of try to mirror what they're seeing. The way\n",
    "\n",
    "06:43.880 --> 06:47.170\n",
    "it's being formed in the mouth, or is there. Is it more about understanding where\n",
    "\n",
    "06:47.670 --> 06:49.770\n",
    "to place the tongue and move the lips? How would you go about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "06:50.090 --> 06:53.450\n",
    "That is such a great question because it\n",
    "\n",
    "06:53.950 --> 06:57.490\n",
    "really depends. Different learners learn and improve differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "06:57.990 --> 07:01.650\n",
    "Right. So sometimes I would be like explaining to a student what\n",
    "\n",
    "07:02.150 --> 07:05.530\n",
    "they need to do and they'd be like, what? And then I just say\n",
    "\n",
    "07:06.030 --> 07:09.170\n",
    "the sound and they'd be like, oh, you know, and repeat it\n",
    "\n",
    "07:09.670 --> 07:13.130\n",
    "and imitate it quickly. Others need to see a diagram and see exactly\n",
    "\n",
    "07:13.450 --> 07:17.210\n",
    "what the tongue is doing. Right. Others need to the entire explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "07:17.690 --> 07:21.350\n",
    "And some just need a lot of examples and repetition and just,\n",
    "\n",
    "07:21.850 --> 07:25.310\n",
    "you know, I help them fine tune it by giving them some more imageries\n",
    "\n",
    "07:25.810 --> 07:29.070\n",
    "or notes. So like, you know, sometimes I see stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "07:29.570 --> 07:32.910\n",
    "like imagine like you have a hot potato in your mouth. Right. For some people\n",
    "\n",
    "07:33.410 --> 07:36.470\n",
    "it'd be like, what? For others, boom, you know,\n",
    "\n",
    "07:37.030 --> 07:40.310\n",
    "that's what. Exactly. So it really depends.\n",
    "\n",
    "07:40.810 --> 07:43.710\n",
    "And as a coach, I try to go back and forth and see what resonates\n",
    "\n",
    "07:44.210 --> 07:47.470\n",
    "with the student and what gets them to make that sound good. And then I\n",
    "\n",
    "07:47.970 --> 07:51.210\n",
    "just continue with that. Yeah, that's so important because there's not one way of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "07:51.710 --> 07:54.290\n",
    "to make these sounds. Everyone learns in a different way. And that's so key to\n",
    "\n",
    "07:54.790 --> 07:57.770\n",
    "really speak to students, where they're at, how they learn. I love it. Okay,\n",
    "\n",
    "07:58.090 --> 08:01.370\n",
    "so we're at the practice stage, Hadar. So then what would be\n",
    "\n",
    "08:01.870 --> 08:05.050\n",
    "the next step? Once we've done perception and pronounce,\n",
    "\n",
    "08:05.550 --> 08:06.970\n",
    "I guess. And then what? What would be the next step?\n",
    "\n",
    "08:09.930 --> 08:13.930\n",
    "Guys, today you're meeting our guest, Hadar Shemesh. Make sure to go over\n",
    "\n",
    "08:14.430 --> 08:17.960\n",
    "and check out her podcast, the Invite Fluency Podcast and\n",
    "\n",
    "08:18.460 --> 08:21.080\n",
    "subscribe to get more from Hadar. Thanks for listening.\n",
    "\n",
    "08:26.680 --> 08:29.800\n",
    "Well, the next step is building pronunciation confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "08:29.880 --> 08:33.400\n",
    "Okay. Which is also practice. Right. So basically\n",
    "\n",
    "08:33.900 --> 08:37.440\n",
    "practicing the sound. Now, practicing the sound doesn't mean to just say 10 words\n",
    "\n",
    "08:37.940 --> 08:41.480\n",
    "with the same sound and that's it. So you want to be very intentional about\n",
    "\n",
    "08:41.980 --> 08:45.330\n",
    "the practice. A lot of people practice practice and drill words, but they repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "08:45.650 --> 08:49.250\n",
    "the same patterns that they bring over from their native language.\n",
    "\n",
    "08:49.330 --> 08:53.330\n",
    "Of course. So, for example, going back to the R, let's say you're a\n",
    "\n",
    "08:53.830 --> 08:57.570\n",
    "Spanish speaker and then you have a tendency of saying instead of R.\n",
    "\n",
    "08:57.730 --> 09:00.290\n",
    "So. Right. Instead of right. Right.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:01.250 --> 09:04.650\n",
    "So you know how to say the R. Maybe you have practiced it\n",
    "\n",
    "09:05.150 --> 09:08.770\n",
    "before. But then you drill sounds and you keep saying run red.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:09.280 --> 09:13.360\n",
    "Right. And you keep tapping that tongue against the upper palate.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:13.860 --> 09:17.800\n",
    "Yeah. And you don't even notice. So. And then you just perpetuate that mistake\n",
    "\n",
    "09:18.300 --> 09:21.640\n",
    "and you build, you build the muscle memory of the mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:22.140 --> 09:25.239\n",
    "Right. Like it's not a mistake, but it's a mispronunciation, let's say.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:25.739 --> 09:28.800\n",
    "Right. Like it's not the American R or the British are.\n",
    "\n",
    "09:29.440 --> 09:33.280\n",
    "So as a result, like it's just you, the person\n",
    "\n",
    "09:33.780 --> 09:37.160\n",
    "might be practicing, but without seeing the results that they're after because the\n",
    "\n",
    "09:37.660 --> 09:41.260\n",
    "practice wasn't intentional. Yes. You want to make sure that\n",
    "\n",
    "09:41.760 --> 09:45.420\n",
    "when you practice, you have some guidance or tools and\n",
    "\n",
    "09:45.920 --> 09:48.700\n",
    "doesn't mean that you have to go and seek for coaching, but you need to\n",
    "\n",
    "09:48.860 --> 09:52.620\n",
    "just pay attention to look in the mirror to feel your tongue if\n",
    "\n",
    "09:53.120 --> 09:56.420\n",
    "needed, to record yourself, see if it's different, if it feels too\n",
    "\n",
    "09:56.920 --> 10:00.500\n",
    "comfortable. Usually you're going back with patterns. Right. If it\n",
    "\n",
    "10:01.000 --> 10:04.460\n",
    "feels weird and artificial, you're probably on the\n",
    "\n",
    "10:04.960 --> 10:07.820\n",
    "right track because doing something different will make you feel a little,\n",
    "\n",
    "10:08.700 --> 10:12.460\n",
    "you know, it's going to feel a little awkward, but you practice it enough times\n",
    "\n",
    "10:12.860 --> 10:16.220\n",
    "and then you make your own. I love that that's so important. Muscle memory\n",
    "\n",
    "10:16.720 --> 10:20.460\n",
    "is so powerful in both ways. If we do it wrong, we're teaching ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "10:20.960 --> 10:24.019\n",
    "very bad habits that are getting cemented. Right. I mean, I know this in\n",
    "\n",
    "10:24.519 --> 10:28.180\n",
    "the opposite direction of having studied Spanish for a long time and Having lived\n",
    "\n",
    "10:28.680 --> 10:31.940\n",
    "a little bit in Latin America and then now starting to lose my\n",
    "\n",
    "10:32.440 --> 10:35.740\n",
    "accent, unfortunately. And so I'm going in the opposite direction. And so I can\n",
    "\n",
    "10:36.240 --> 10:39.420\n",
    "feel that when I pronounce Spanish words, it just doesn't feel natural anym.\n",
    "\n",
    "10:40.200 --> 10:44.160\n",
    "And so it can happen in both ways, for sure. And it's also the muscles.\n",
    "\n",
    "10:44.660 --> 10:47.880\n",
    "Right. Let's not forget that these are muscles, so you need to strengthen them.\n",
    "\n",
    "10:47.960 --> 10:51.520\n",
    "It's not like, okay, you're not going to the gym for two years. How would\n",
    "\n",
    "10:52.020 --> 10:55.480\n",
    "you expect to be in shape? Right, Exactly. I mean, we can build new muscle\n",
    "\n",
    "10:55.980 --> 10:59.040\n",
    "fibers in our biceps after a few weeks at the gym, so why couldn't\n",
    "\n",
    "10:59.540 --> 11:02.600\n",
    "we do it with our mouths, with making those sounds? I love that mentality.\n",
    "\n",
    "11:03.080 --> 11:06.640\n",
    "Exactly, Exactly. It should be addressed exactly the\n",
    "\n",
    "11:07.140 --> 11:10.200\n",
    "same way. I love it. And also, it's like ongoing work, like you say,\n",
    "\n",
    "11:10.700 --> 11:13.980\n",
    "you know, you haven't done it in a while, you get rusty, and then you're\n",
    "\n",
    "11:14.480 --> 11:17.540\n",
    "not as sharp, and it doesn't feel as smooth and effortless.\n",
    "\n",
    "11:18.040 --> 11:22.060\n",
    "Yeah. We have to nurture this skill 100%. 100%. Okay. Absolutely. So then\n",
    "\n",
    "11:22.560 --> 11:24.860\n",
    "this is great. So I love this framework. So then what's our next step?\n",
    "\n",
    "11:25.360 --> 11:27.340\n",
    "I feel like there are a couple more steps to really make sure we bring\n",
    "\n",
    "11:27.840 --> 11:30.900\n",
    "it out there with. With. Out in a conversation, really.\n",
    "\n",
    "11:31.700 --> 11:34.900\n",
    "Right. So now you need to start implementing\n",
    "\n",
    "11:35.400 --> 11:39.020\n",
    "what you have practiced. Let's assume that you've practiced the R and\n",
    "\n",
    "11:39.520 --> 11:42.820\n",
    "you were intentional about it, and you drilled it in words and phrases and sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "11:43.320 --> 11:46.360\n",
    "and tackled challenging transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "11:46.600 --> 11:49.920\n",
    "And now. But you still. You feel that you're still not using\n",
    "\n",
    "11:50.420 --> 11:53.200\n",
    "it in a conversation. Right. It's not there for you. You go back to your\n",
    "\n",
    "11:53.700 --> 11:57.000\n",
    "old habits. So the next step is still, like, that's a buffer step,\n",
    "\n",
    "11:57.080 --> 12:00.360\n",
    "which is, okay, don't use it yet in\n",
    "\n",
    "12:00.860 --> 12:04.600\n",
    "real life because there's the whole aspect of judgment. And then you think about your\n",
    "\n",
    "12:05.100 --> 12:08.400\n",
    "English, too, and about, you know, how to structure the sentence and\n",
    "\n",
    "12:08.900 --> 12:11.240\n",
    "vocabulary. There's a lot that goes into it. So you want to make it automatic,\n",
    "\n",
    "12:12.030 --> 12:14.430\n",
    "but also, it doesn't happen on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:15.790 --> 12:19.110\n",
    "So the next step would be to practice on your\n",
    "\n",
    "12:19.610 --> 12:22.990\n",
    "own. So to record yourself speaking freely or to read out\n",
    "\n",
    "12:23.490 --> 12:27.310\n",
    "loud, but to focus on one or two sounds\n",
    "\n",
    "12:27.390 --> 12:30.750\n",
    "and to make sure that you are actually using them. Right. So to\n",
    "\n",
    "12:31.250 --> 12:34.430\n",
    "start using it not in drills, but in real,\n",
    "\n",
    "12:34.830 --> 12:38.760\n",
    "you know, in real conversation. But recommend\n",
    "\n",
    "12:39.260 --> 12:42.080\n",
    "that it's still you on your own. Right. Like, not you speaking to other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:42.580 --> 12:46.160\n",
    "So there's less judgment and more permission. Yeah. And then.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:47.520 --> 12:50.160\n",
    "Mm. Right. So people are a lot better.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:50.960 --> 12:54.280\n",
    "You know, they say after there was a research that\n",
    "\n",
    "12:54.780 --> 12:58.680\n",
    "showed that people who have a glass of wine, their pronunciation improves because.\n",
    "\n",
    "12:59.180 --> 13:02.920\n",
    "Not that I'm encouraging people to consume\n",
    "\n",
    "13:03.420 --> 13:06.500\n",
    "alcohol, but it says that, like, when you're less judgmental, there is more\n",
    "\n",
    "13:07.000 --> 13:10.140\n",
    "freedom, especially when it comes to pronunciation and English and fluency in\n",
    "\n",
    "13:10.640 --> 13:13.660\n",
    "general. Interesting. That is such an interesting insight. Yeah. You know, I think this is\n",
    "\n",
    "13:14.160 --> 13:16.180\n",
    "a step that a lot of students skip, and this may be the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "13:16.340 --> 13:20.020\n",
    "Right. They go from classroom learning drilling to let's\n",
    "\n",
    "13:20.520 --> 13:23.660\n",
    "go into the middle of a conversation in a crowded nightclub or party, and I\n",
    "\n",
    "13:24.160 --> 13:26.740\n",
    "should be able to do it. Right. And of course not. So I like that\n",
    "\n",
    "13:27.240 --> 13:30.580\n",
    "you're adding in this step. Right. And so you do it on your own,\n",
    "\n",
    "13:31.080 --> 13:34.900\n",
    "but you simulate, like a real conversation, but you're still safe. And ideally, if you\n",
    "\n",
    "13:35.400 --> 13:38.720\n",
    "record yourself, I would recommend to listen back to it and to observe your performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "13:39.040 --> 13:43.520\n",
    "So good going back to, you know, the physical activity. Even athletes,\n",
    "\n",
    "13:43.680 --> 13:46.240\n",
    "you know, when they're on the field and they,\n",
    "\n",
    "13:46.480 --> 13:49.720\n",
    "you know, after a game, they will watch the videos of the\n",
    "\n",
    "13:50.220 --> 13:53.280\n",
    "game and see their performance. Because when you're in your body doing whatever it is\n",
    "\n",
    "13:53.360 --> 13:56.800\n",
    "when you're on the field, then you're not aware of many\n",
    "\n",
    "13:57.300 --> 14:00.960\n",
    "of the things or many patterns that you. That you tend to\n",
    "\n",
    "14:01.760 --> 14:05.460\n",
    "go into. And. And when you listen back to it, like,\n",
    "\n",
    "14:05.960 --> 14:09.180\n",
    "listen to your recording, you can notice a lot of things, and then it's a\n",
    "\n",
    "14:09.680 --> 14:13.340\n",
    "lot easier to decide if you want to keep it or change it to tweak\n",
    "\n",
    "14:13.840 --> 14:16.980\n",
    "from there. Yeah, that makes total sense. Okay, so now after we've done all of\n",
    "\n",
    "14:17.480 --> 14:21.180\n",
    "this, we've learned the sounds, we've pronounced them, we've done our practice recording\n",
    "\n",
    "14:21.680 --> 14:24.660\n",
    "ourselves, listening for sounds. What do we do next? I'm guessing that we want to\n",
    "\n",
    "14:25.160 --> 14:31.920\n",
    "try to know if you go into the real world and\n",
    "\n",
    "14:32.420 --> 14:35.440\n",
    "then, you know. So on one hand, if you've done all of that, a lot\n",
    "\n",
    "14:35.940 --> 14:39.200\n",
    "of the work will show up for you spontaneously. That's the great\n",
    "\n",
    "14:39.700 --> 14:43.080\n",
    "part about practicing or building pronunciation confidence. But it's going to show\n",
    "\n",
    "14:43.580 --> 14:47.080\n",
    "up for you, and sometimes you won't even notice that it's there. You'll start getting\n",
    "\n",
    "14:47.580 --> 14:51.520\n",
    "feedback from people. Right? Fantastic. Yeah. But if\n",
    "\n",
    "14:52.020 --> 14:56.900\n",
    "you want to really, you know, seal the deal, then use\n",
    "\n",
    "14:57.400 --> 15:00.780\n",
    "it intentionally every time. Focus on, as I said, not everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "15:00.940 --> 15:04.060\n",
    "Not. Don't try to integrate everything that you've learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "15:04.560 --> 15:08.340\n",
    "That's just not going. That's going to make you feel overwhelmed\n",
    "\n",
    "15:08.840 --> 15:12.620\n",
    "and frustrated. So let's say you worked on R and intonation and Th.\n",
    "\n",
    "15:12.780 --> 15:16.340\n",
    "Say, okay, you go into conversation or a meeting, and probably it\n",
    "\n",
    "15:16.840 --> 15:19.980\n",
    "shouldn't be the most important meeting of your career, right? So you\n",
    "\n",
    "15:20.480 --> 15:24.300\n",
    "go into a meeting and you have that small talk at the beginning. Be intentional\n",
    "\n",
    "15:24.800 --> 15:27.890\n",
